# Secure Coding Principles CTF (AppSecVilllage.github.io)

This challenge was inspired and based on OWASP's Secure Coding Dojo. We are hoping to gameify secure coding. This CTF is for beginners who want to familiarize themselves with these concepts, and haven't played CTFs in the past. The goal is to educate anyone playing about some secure coding principles, and apply them to their daily work routines. This challenge was created by Mrs Skelli, S4t4n, Night, Akwa, Rob, sociallyencrypted, Craig!x and many more contributors. Thanks for playing!
